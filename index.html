                In this thesis, I wish to create a space for reflection on noise
                and language. Through myths as a lens, I look upon the landscape
                of Moldova as a place that informs identity; both an individual
                and a collective one. I start with myths and connect them to the
                Moldovan landscape. In this landscape, language and rituals
                serve as a political framework for the historical myths and
                geopolitics. I look upon those relations to understand the
                intentions of myths and how they relate to our times and
                collective memory. Can a dominant narrative change a place
                through myths? Whose narrative becomes the important one and
                which one remains suppressed? Returning to a period of
                colonization, I look into language as a tool for power and
                homogenization. If myths are a place, sound becomes the language
                of that place. When myths are used as a political tool to inform
                and suppress a collective identity, anything that does not fit
                into the narrative of the myths is considered noise. But can
                noise and listening serve as a space for resistance?

                Myths have played a crucial role throughout human history in
                making sense of difficult natural concepts such as why it rains
                and why a landscape changes. By personifying phenomena or
                abstract concepts, myths provide a narrative framework that can
                make these concepts more accessible and relatable to human
                understanding. Myths are cultural common places.

                Roland Barthes mentions that myths are a type of speech, as
                myths function as a system of communication that generates
                meaning. Myths are relatively simple stories that through the
                use of metaphors and other narration tools, cut to the core of
                what it means to be human. While new myths emerge from the most
                daily practices and everyday habits of contemporary life,
                ancient ones are continuously reinterpreted and contextualized
                within the present. Myth allows us to imagine another present,
                past and future, another way of being and living, and create
                bridges from the here and now to the there and then.<sup
                  class="footnote"
                  ><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup
                >
                As any stories, myths needs a place to live, a context to become
                alive. And as every piece of land has it’s own rules, what
                happens when they go out of the literature margins and become a
                political tool? Myths are both embedded in our everyday rituals,
                our language and our visual culture. When these become the
                result of historical political structures, is it still possible
                to reimagine another time free from such frameworks?
              </p>
              <p>
                <br />
                Mircea Eliade writes that a traditional society needs myths to
                live and to have a sense of belonging, meaning and security. The
                myth is regarded as a sacred story, and hence a "true history",
                because it always deals with the realities.<sup class="footnote"

                Myths become a “role model” to follow as an “absolute truth”, in
                which we believe, when we detach from our personal values to act
                and follow such a “role model”. In this way, myths become a form
                of excellent cognitive thinking performed in the form of
                rituals. <br><br>

                I grew up in Moldova. Moldova has been colonized many times, by
                the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, and
                the Soviet Union. Thus we still carry the “noise” and traces
                from such histories and different colonizers in the form of
                food, rituals, celebrations, street names, and even speech on
                the land. In general terms, noise is considered unwanted or loud
                sounds, but in the context of colonization, I’m referring to
                noise as a symbol of the cultural and ecological pollution of a
                territory.

                In the following lines, I’ll try to find answers to these

                the last era of colonization, which effects I still hear today
                the most. I didn’t grow up directly in the Soviet Union, I
                experienced the effects of it through the subjective
                perspectives of my family, in the patterns that the country is
                still keeping. The story I will bring to you now is also a
                subjective one. I referring to the political ideology as a myth,
                the one that become role model for more then a decade and
                changed the collective identity and even memory, becouse its
                dominance.

              <p>
                Let’s begin with the invasion. In 1940 geo-political and
                geo-strategic interests from the Soviet Union, on the land of
                Moldova then named Bessarabia, became more intense. In order to
                hide their geo-strategic interests of occupying the territory, a
                more believable narrative was needed. According to their
                narrative, Moldovans is actually a separate nation with no link
                to Romania and closer in historical destiny and culture to the
                Russian, Ukrainian and other Soviet people’s history than to the
                Romanian nation.
                <br /><br />
                So, the “becoming” of the Moldovan nation went through an
                aggressive intervention at many levels. From a political level
                the colonization meant to cancel a democratic institution and
                the instauration of a new ideology. As the main intention is to
                build a strong military and economic force, the soviet ideology
                meant a transformation and direction of a whole society. From a
                society level, it meant an instauration of new set of beliefs,
                that will facilitate the new idea/ ideology.
                <br /><br />
                That mean the restructuring if the ideoA way of directing a
                whole society was through political myths. Ionuț Isac writes
                about political myths and define them as a subjective belief
                that provides a common foundational belief system of one’s
                origins, identities and goals on both an individual and
                collective national level: “Political myth can be said to fix
                its 'referent' at a confluence of objective and subjective,
                reality and fiction, which makes it no "weaker" than an
                elaborate social theory or ideology, but even more powerful than
                them when it comes to impressing and moving human communities
                and collectivities.” Political myths are not directly rooted in
                present reality, but instead they construct a future reality to
                make people act differently in a present, as if the constructed
                future already existed.

                  I invite you on a short walk through the capital of Moldova,
                  Chisinau. What we have in front of you is the highest (15
                  meters!) monument in Chisinau of a hero, of a former country
                  that already does not exist, Sergei Lazo. The monument is
                  placed in front of a public park representing a mythological
                  hero. Mythologies are cultural common places, recurrent
                  narratives that are perceived as natural in a given culture
                  but in fact were naturalized and their historical, political,
                  or literary origins forgotten or disguised. Sergei Lazo is an
                  example of such mythological common narrative.

                <br /><br />
                <p>
                  The following lines are based on a documentary movie titled
                  Lazo about Lazo as a mythological character from the Soviet
                  Union, directed and written by Stefan Rusu.
                  <br /><br />
                  When the Soviets colonized Moldova, a set of symbols was
                  invented to prove the existence of Moldovan national identity,
                  but also to rewrite and demystify the local history and its
                  heroes. To recreate a collective memory of the local history
                  and demystify it. The country had to deal with an updated
                  version of the present and to reimagine the past; a form of
                  past that served the soviet ideals. Sergei Lazo is a character
                  and person who was reconstructed as a hero and who is an
                  example of such recreation. He suddenly became a “hero” and
                  perfectly fitted into soviet mythology. I’m referring to
                  soviet mythology, to a soviet ideology that was promoted over
                  the occupied land. In that recreation, he was suddenly
                  dedicated to a series of monuments, street names, museums,
                  squares, institutions and factories titles all around the
                  country.
                  <br /><br />
                  Lazo was born in Moldova into a noble family. During his study
                  in Sankt Petersburg and Moscow, he was active in revolutionary
                  circles. Later he joined the Bolshevik forces and participated
                  in the Russian Civil War and had the position of the second
                  front line. At the time, he was not very well known as a
                  dominant figure or hero. In the context of the Civil War, when
                  the Red Army excited his elite, the Soviets had to come up
                  with a solution to supplement the lack of dominant figures.
                  People from the frontline were used to create stories of
                  heroes. So in the case of Moldova, the soviets made Lazo
                  become a hero as part of a heroic war.

                  One “proof” of the story was the novel for young adults
                  written by a preeminent soviet novelist Aleksandeer Fadeev
                  titled Kak pogib Sergeĭ Lazo, translated as The Death of
                  Sergei Lazo. The novel is supported by a series of
                  illustrations of the war and has Lazo as a dominant figure. He
                  is described as being extremely courageous, good in math and
                  with incredible oratorical capacities etc. A big part of the
                  novel was dedicated to the death of Lazo; proofing the legend
                  of being burned alive in a locomotive oven.

                <p>
                  Alongside that, two film was made about Lazo, comsioned by
                  Moldova Film, one was commissioning Andrei Tarkovsky together
                  with Aleksander Gordon to make a future film about the
                  national hero “Sergei Lazo”. Another one “The Life and
                  Immortality of Sergei Lazo” (1985) by V. Pascaru. With an
                  interesting end, where the voice over says “You need to find
                  the truth even in the most uneven places… tragedy of personal
                  life and death disappears when person feel himself as a unit
                  of a whole humanity and recognizes the meaning of his
                  existence in the result of his work and benefit that these
                  abilities bring to…” The film made a substantial contribution
                  to sustain the legend about Lazo

                  In the public space, monuments and streets named in the name
                  of the new national hero were appearing. Like the one in park
                  in Chisinau, named after him, the park Sergei Lazo. “ Brassier
                  argues that a cognitive event is produced by noise that
                  divides thought and feeling and has the potential to generate
                  a new subject.” In Russia, nowadays, Lazo is not a hero
                  anymore. The tragic death of Lazo and even his life have
                  recently dismissed by researchers as “the country that made
                  him a hero is no longer on the map” . Instead, the shadow, or
                  maybe beter the symbol of the myth is still present in
                  Chisinau.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a decaying concrete platform, weakened through time, a base
                  as a timeline reminds us that the myth is still with us, but
                  we do not understand its face anymore, as its meaning does not
                  mean anything anymore. A strong-standing hero morphing into a
                  landscape, like a blind spot in our memory, is present, but
                  absent. It is big, it is impressive and it creates a sense of
                  an unknown anxiety - like a traumatic experience that goes
                  through generations. How long can a myth keep living?

                We didn’t move even one meter from Lazo Park, when I met you. Do
                you remember how we are in Chisinau now? Can you believe what
                you see in front of you? Mythologies are cultural common places,
                recurrent narratives that are perceived as natural in a given
                culture, but in fact were naturalized and their historical,
                political, or literary origins forgotten or disguised.<br /><br />
                As part of creating a new collective identity, museums had to
                convey the myths as well. Right after the soviet occupation, all
                the existing collection works from the young established museum
                (opened in 1939) were loaded onto two wagons and shipped to
                Kharkiv in Ukraine. The existence of the works is still unknown
                today. The works in the museum were replaced by works donated by
                the Tretyakov State Gallery and A. S. Pushkin State Museum of
                Fine Arts in Moscow, as well as by the Leningrad State
                Hermitage.<br /><br />
                To supplement the lost heritage, Moldovan Soviet Socialist
                Republic was funding museums to commission and purchase works of
                art - usually from local masters in the field of fine arts.
                Alongside, a series of donations were made by some collectors
                and prominent personalities in the field of arts from
                Bessarabia.
                <br /><br />
                The system promoted realistic paintings, but was in opposition
                to the pseudo-realist style of socialist academism. A style that
                was advocated by the Academy of Arts of the USSR in the early
                post-war years. However, socialist academism was based on
                exaggerating to the point of absurdity with the forms of
                "fable", "content" and "narrative" in painting.

                One of the works, acquired by the MSSR museum in the period of
                restoring the lost collection, was the painting “Glie și
                Oamenii” in translation “Lands and people”, by Moldovan painter
                Valentina Rusu-Ciobanu, exhibited at the exhibition “Glory to
                the work” in 1975. The work represent an image of the village
                during autumn, in a period of harvesting. The village is
                equipped with the most modern achievements of technological
                progress in the agro-industrial sphere, also showing the great
                improvements, the greate upgrade made by the state on a
                colonised land. Fused with happy looking characters of local
                communal work, dressed in perfect, clean clothes, running
                tractors, electricity towers, somenone is biking somewhere,
                running cars, a red car in front of the main village, as a sigh
                of communist party is duing its duties too, perfectly organised
                working life, actively implicated into a communal growth, a
                communal rhythm, a common place. Everyone is happy, no one human
                presence in the houses of the village, because everyone is on
                the land. The image that showing just a part of something big.
                What can go wrong?
                <br /><br />
                This upgraded version of the Moldovan village, painted following
                the ideological criteria of those years, isn’t that simple and
                perfect. If we take a step back, the image dosen’t feel natural
                at all, even more, the portraited vilage do no exist. The
                painting is just an image of what the state wanted to see, a
                desired image of a village, a mythological image of the space.
                We are looking into an imagination, into a dream, into utopia,
                into a project that wants to change the humans and shape th
                land, in order to achieve its own goals. A “reality”, “virtual
                reality”, covered into a noise of dominant culture, where even
                is hard to depict were that “reality” is.
                <br /><br />
                From another side, the painting is reflecting the spiritual part
                of the place, the transcendental. What dose it mean to be
                suppressed? The language of spiritual is hiden in the language
                of the myth, if we erase the ideological elements, if we take
                apart what “have to be”, then we might find a real village. The
                land is exploited, the culture is modified, the common place
                organised and re-organised, the myth limits, the language is a
                myth, metaphor.
                <br /><br />
                Lands and People refers to the painting of Landscape with the
                Fall of Icarus by Pieter Bruegel, that can be interpreted as
                “the flight of Icarus symbolizes the flight of human thought and
                imagination; the human desire for new discoveries, achievements,
                conquests. In this case, the painting can be interpreted as the
                defeat of the sublime in the struggle against the commonplace,
                which does not care about those who strive for light".
                <br /><br />
                Even thought the painting was made according to the ideological
                formula, the artist was accused by the party for being too
                abstract and formalistic, which meant the message was not too
                clear and it could produce additional meaning. Although the
                party did not even have a clear explanation on what abstract and
                formalistic meant, I guess it did not limit itself to the
                “reality” of the myth. The painting Lands and People, painted in
                the context of the myth is just an example of the tools used by
                the state. Could we relate to our time? Could our images, our
                technology to work in the same way?

                Myths are considered a type of speech. Roland writes that
                language needs special conditions to become a myth. Relating
                this to the history of Moldova, the historical conditions that
                affected the language and its effects can still be heard till
                now.
                <br /><br />
                To just remind you; we are still in front of the park in
                Chisinau. As you can hear, besides the sound of passing cars,
                you will hear an intertwining soundscape of voices mostly
                composed of Romanian and Russian. In our everyday life in common
                places, intertwined communication is something “natural”. It is
                something common. What kind of language do we speak? The answer
                to that is a long-lasting political and social dispute that goes
                back to 1991, when Moldova became independent. Moldovan or
                Romanian? And where is the difference?
                <br /><br />
                Let me start by pointing to the fact that we are filling the
                gaps in the Romanian language with Russian words, even after
                declaration of independence, which count more then 30 years. But
                also after reforms, national movements of restoring the national
                language. In **** year, romanian language was contitutionaly
                recognised a national language. And even before that that was
                also a political tool, but in this case to use moldoval language
                to bring nostalgic feeling about colonial past.
                <br /><br />
                I don’t want to sound nationalistic, when I write about the
                effects of colonization and I do acknowledge how no language is
                not affected by other languages anymore, but Romanian language
                carries traces of Russian colonization, which do not originate
                within the language. The noises that are blending the speech,
                the sentences, filling it till we can formulate a whole message
                are a trace of such history; forcing one language to translate
                itself into another. Till you can understand what we want to
                say. This is not accidental. These noises are political embedded
                codes in our unconsciousness.

                During Soviet Union, language came to serve as a political tool,
                when it was used to strengthen the border, to “protect” the
                people and to isolate Moldova from Romania. It was a political
                tool when it came to “erase any national local differences and
                to transform the whole body of the country, to a brotherhood
                nation which speaks the same language”. One example is how the
                Latin alphabet script was changed to Cyrillic one. In order to
                expand the communist idology, and combat illiteracy. When the
                language of the colony did not have enough shapes for sounds,
                they had to invent a unique new letter to transcribe the
                Romanian phonetics. For example with g, ge, ghe /dʒ/, they made
                the sound zhe with breve “Ӂ ӂ”.The moving towards Cyrillics
                meant taking part in the national development and homogenizing
                the whole culture into a land of brothers and sisters. This
                homogenization meant excluding any minorities, as the whole
                culture was homogenized into national. Along with that
                transformation, another Russian language had apriveledged
                position, was a language of the state, formal language. As well
                russian was studied at schools, as well mixing russian and
                romanian (then moldovan language) school, in this way
                facilitating bilinvism.

                The language went through a massive act of brushing from the
                Romanian words, along with literature, songs and anything that
                could remind or produce nostalgic feelings about the past. But
                overall, there is no difference between Romanian and Moldavian
                language. To see them as different is purely a political tool.
                The romanian words was excluded from literature, as it could
                recall the nostalgic feelings that the Soviet Union did not
                desire. Such feelings would mean uncertainty. In 1950 linguists
                from abroad started studying the Moldovan language and found
                that “the only difference they could conclude was writing with
                Cyrillic alphabet and minor mutation in diphthongs and the
                backing of some vowels after hard consonants. Tagkivini
                described it as a mere “dogma of soviet linguistics”. As such
                any differences are minor.

                The national uprising and the de-russification processes came at
                the end of the 1980s, when Moldova reverted to the Latin
                spelling. In the text Land, water and Commas from 1987, Ion
                Druta refers to language as a limited source and as a natural
                resource, which was exploited like land. He writes that
                resources refer to culture, language, and history, which
                impacted the poverty of the spirit, the cosmos of man, the
                ecology of man and so the ecology of the soul. In addition to
                the damage caused by the phantasmagorical tendencies of the
                system, the language has also suffered a lot. Its charm has
                begun to disappear and instead turned into a dirty, grey
                language. A language that blocks even those who were
                participating in a conversation; no longer understanding what
                they want to say to each other.
                <br /><br />
                In 2003 a controversial Romanian-Moldovan dictionary was
                published, being the first and only one of its kind. The book
                represented a sum of archaism, regionalism, and russificated
                words specific to the Moldovan area. The book pretends to show
                that the Moldovan language is something different from the
                Romanian one, but in fact is a sum of old and modified words,
                translated into modern romanian language, but from another side
                show the complexity of the language.
                <br /><br />
                Even though I don’t know why, I still find it difficult to use
                words in my native language. There is a constant filter and
                restructuring of the meaning. Fear, anxiety, and hope to be
                understood. My language is intertwined between Romanian and
                Russian, and now even more complex, with English too. All those
                words come to fill the gaps. In the end, silence and errors are
                a common space; a metaphor for resistance.

				What are the characteristics of myths? Roland Barthes defines them as the transformation of a meaning into form. To give it a shape, as the meaning becomes a set of pre-designed signifiers. Within myths, meaning is never absent and any absence is considered noise. An example is informational entropy. It is a concept in physics and a metaphor in statistical analysis, which refers to the predictability of the message. A predictability as a calculation of information probability. The theory explains that information is structured in a set of possible answers that could cover all kinds of possible narratives. So the “freedom of choice” is actually a set of pre-designed choices. All possible errors are considered “noises”. The predictability of the constructed system helps to keep a control and understand the behavior of the system. In this way, myths become “naturalized”. Myths like to be in a shape that is steady and convincing. Everything outside such a form will be considered noise.
				But nothing is perfect and we can’t avoid errors and gaps. Just as grammar works as a framework for language of correctness, myths also carry a grammar. When something is not according to the grammar, it is wrong and limited to A or B. 
				Uncertainty is what does not live up to the grammar. It is what’s considered noise. Noise becomes the refuse and a leftover generated by the process of information itself. Ray Brassier writes about noise in the article Against an Aesthetics of Noise. According to him, noise is more than an ambivalent object that relates to the true or false foundation. Insteads, it is a space where we can learn about our relation to information, as noise goes beyond the organized form of a system. 
				In the book Listening Biennial, Daniela Medina Poch writes: “Listening allows a space for unlearning and relearning as listening requires being open towards what is being listened to.” As noise is what is refused by a dominant culture and everything outside myths therefore will be considered noise, to listen to such noise is a certain resistance, as noise allows a multitude of voices to speak together, when sound is an interconnected world and not a singular voice, as sound exists because of many relations within spaces and the relationship of cause and effect. As colonization is a voice that homogenizes by silencing the rest, decolonization instead should be focused on listening; not overshatter past voices, but to acknowledge those interconnections and a plurality of voices to co-exist.
				But to listen does not only remain within sound, it is also a concept that can be applied to history, when listening becomes a form of attention. To pay attention to what surrounds one, not overshatter with a singular worldview and to be open towards the voices and opinions of others. Within these pages, listening has served as a method of looking upon patterns within history and how they resulted in shaping a present Moldova, from which I am from. To look beyond a singular voice of the Soviet Union and instead listen to the relationships of different interconnections that ended up shaping both the Moldovan language, myths and landscape. To listen is to pay attention. And to listen to what has been framed as noise outside a dominant system is an act of resistance.
