                  This thesis explores how myths become embedded in collective
                  identities and how noise can serve as a form of resistance to
                  myths. Starting from a personal perspective and moving to a
                  broader one, I’m exploring three specific narratives that
                  shape the collective identity in Moldova: language as a
                  political tool for homogenization, visual culture as a
                  representation of power and the role of heroes in reinforcing
                  those narratives. By researching historical and geopolitical
                  myths, I seek to understand their purpose and significance in
                  contemporary society. When myths are utilized as political
                  tools to influence collective identities, anything that does
                  not align with the narrative is often perceived as chaos or
                  noise. As such, one question remains: What do these noises
                  truly signify?

                  Geography is never neutral and borders are shaped by politics.
                  I grew up in Moldova; a country with a complex history. A
                  country that through decades went through many territorial and
                  political transformations. My common physical surroundings are
                  mostly based on post-Soviet imaginaries. Some symbols are
                  gradually decaying. Some buildings are becoming ruins and
                  disappearing into the land, while other elements keep living
                  in different forms by changing their functionalities. The
                  presence of them is a reminder of a past history of
                  colonization.

              <div class="part1-block part1-block-2">
                <p>
                  I do believe that the ruins, which I in the following chapters
                  name noises, are not limited to their physical presence. But
                  they are noises that go deeper into both the culture and
                  language of Moldova. I use the term noise from multiple
                  perspectives, as in the frame of colonization see the term as
                  a force, which invades a space to influence it. In this way,
                  noise is an unwanted sound, as the suppressed culture is
                  infused by another dominant culture. Another perspective on
                  noise is looking upon it as a form of resistance, as I refer
                  to noise as a methodology to look beyond set forms and
                  political norms. Can noise as involuntary fluctuations become
                  a source for knowledge? A source to detach from what we
                  consider normal? And is it possible to reimagine another
                  geography through noise? A possible geography of plurality?
                </p>

                <p>
                  To take a step back and detach emotionally from the place and
                  history I am from, I use myths as a lens to look upon the
                  present and understand it in relation to the past. Myths are
                  common grounds. Common stories in which a community’s beliefs
                  are built upon. Through my chapters focused on Moldova, I
                  refer to myths as ideological tools with geopolitical
                  intentions. As myths speak about common beliefs, I start from
                  the most common places of national identity, language and
                  territory. Every part in this essay is an attempt to demystify
                  ruins and how it has come to both shape me, but also a
                  collective memory of Moldova. I look upon those structures
                  through the lens of political myths to raise the question: How
                  can we identify the noises within the culture of Moldova to
                  move beyond political myths as naturalized norms?

                  Myths have played a crucial role throughout human history in
                  making sense of difficult natural concepts such as why it
                  rains and why a landscape changes. By personifying phenomena
                  or abstract concepts, myths provide a narrative framework that
                  can make these concepts more accessible and relatable to human
                  understanding. Myths are cultural common places that are
                  perceived as natural in a given culture, but in fact were
                  naturalized and their historical, political or literary
                  origins forgotten or disguised.<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roland Barthes mentions that myths are a type of speech, as
                  myths function as a system of communication that generates
                  meaning. Myths are simple stories that through the use of
                  metaphors cut to the core of what it means to be human. While
                  new myths emerge from the most daily habits of contemporary
                  life, ancient ones are continuously reinterpreted and
                  contextualized within the present. Myths allow us to imagine
                  another present, past and future. Myths create bridges from
                  the here and now to the there and then.<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">2</a></sup
                  >
                  As any story, myths need a context to become alive. Every
                  piece of land has its own rules, but what happens when they go
                  out of the literature margins and become a political tool?
                  Myths are both embedded in our everyday rituals, our language
                  and our visual culture. When these become the result of
                  historical political structures, is it still possible to
                  reimagine another time free from such frameworks?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mircea Eliade writes that a traditional society needs myths to
                  live and to have a sense of belonging, meaning and security.
                  The myth is regarded as a sacred story and hence a "true
                  history".<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">3</a></sup
                  >
                  Myths become a “role model” to follow as an “absolute truth”,
                  in which we believe, when we detach from our personal values
                  to act and follow such a “role model”. In this way, myths
                  become a form of excellent cognitive thinking performed in the
                  form of rituals.

                <p>
                  I grew up in Moldova. Moldova has been colonized many times by
                  the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, and
                  the Soviet Union. Thus we still carry the “noise” and traces
                  from such histories and different colonizers in the form of
                  food, rituals, celebrations, street names, and even speech. In
                  general terms, noise is considered unwanted or loud sounds,
                  but in the context of colonization, I’m referring to noise as
                  a symbol of the cultural and ecological pollution of a
                  territory.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the following lines, I’ll try to find answers to these
                  questions by returning home. Returning to the last era of
                  colonization, which effects I still hear today. I didn’t grow
                  up directly in the Soviet Union. I experienced the effects of
                  it through the subjective perspectives of my family and in the
                  patterns that Moldova still carries. The story I bring to you
                  is a subjective one, as I refer to the political ideology as a
                  myth. One that has become a role model for more than a decade
                  and has changed the collective identity and memory because of
                  its dominance.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let’s begin with the invasion. In 1940 geo-political and
                  geo-strategic interests from the Soviet Union in the land of
                  Bessarabia<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">4</a></sup
                  >
                  became more intense. In order to hide their geo-strategic
                  interests of occupying the territory, a more believable
                  narrative was needed. According to their narrative, Moldova
                  was a separate nation with no link to Romania.<sup
                    class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">5</a></sup
                  >
                  Instead Moldova had a closer historical identity and culture
                  with the Russian, Ukrainian and other Soviet people’s history.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, the “becoming” of the Moldovan nation went through an
                  aggressive intervention at many levels. From a political
                  level, the colonization meant canceling a democratic
                  institution and the instauration of a new ideology.<sup
                    class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">6</a></sup
                  >
                  As the main intention was to build a strong military and
                  economic force, the soviet ideology meant a transformation and
                  redirection of a whole society. From a societal level, it
                  meant an instauration of a new set of beliefs that would
                  facilitate the new ideology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The way of redirecting a whole society was through political
                  myths. Ionuț Isac writes about political myths and define them
                  as a subjective belief that provides a common foundational
                  belief system of one’s origins, identities and goals on both
                  an individual and collective national level: “Political myth
                  can be said to fix its 'referent' at a confluence of objective
                  and subjective, reality and fiction, which makes it no
                  "weaker" than an elaborate social theory or ideology, but even
                  more powerful than them, when it comes to impressing and
                  moving human communities and collectivities.”<sup
                    class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">7</a></sup
                  >
                  Political myths are not directly rooted in present reality,
                  but instead they construct a future reality to make people act
                  differently in a present, as if the constructed future already
                  exists.<sup class="footnote"

                  I would like to invite you on a short walk through the capital
                  of Moldova, Chisinau. What we have in front of us is the
                  highest monument in Chisinau of a hero. The hero of a former
                  country that does not exist - Serghei Lazo. The monument is
                  placed in front of a public park representing a mythological
                  hero. Mythologies are cultural common places. recurrent
                  narratives that are perceived as natural in a given culture,
                  but in fact were naturalized and their historical, political,

                  The following lines are based on a documentary movie titled

                  When the Soviets colonized Moldova, a set of symbols was
                  invented to prove the existence of Moldovan national
                  identity,<sup class="footnote"

                  but also to rewrite and demystify the local history and its
                  heroes. To recreate a collective memory of the local history
                  and demystify it. The country had to deal with an updated
                  version of the present and to reimagine a past that served
                  soviet ideals. Sergei Lazo is a character and person who was
                  reconstructed as a hero and who is an example of such
                  recreation. He suddenly became a “hero” that perfectly fitted
                  into soviet mythology. I’m referring to soviet mythology as a
                  soviet ideology that was promoted over the occupied land. In
                  that recreation, he was suddenly dedicated to titles of a
                  series of monuments, streets, museums, squares, institutions
                  and factories all around the country.

                  Lazo was born in Moldova into a noble family. During his
                  studies in Sankt Petersburg and Moscow, he was active in
                  revolutionary circles. Later he joined the Bolshevik forces
                  and participated in the Russian Civil War. At the time, he was
                  not very well known as a dominant figure. In the context of
                  the Civil War, the Soviets had to come up with a solution to
                  supplement the lack of dominant figures. So in the case of
                  Moldova, the soviets made Lazo become a hero as part of a
                  heroic war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The legend says that Lazo was kept by the Japanese and burned
                  alive. No documentary information could be found about this
                  legend except for a few artistic proofs, which sustained the
                  myth, but also left viewers with a nationalistic feeling of
                  the past.

                  In the public space, monuments and streets named after the new
                  national hero were appearing. One example is in Chisinau,
                  where the park Sergei Lazo was named after him.

                <p>
                  In Russia nowadays, Lazo is not a hero anymore. The tragic
                  death of Lazo and his life have recently been dismissed by
                  researchers as “the country that made him a hero is no longer

                  On a decaying concrete platform, a monument reminds us that
                  the myth is still with us, even when we do not recognize its
                  face anymore. A standing hero morphing into the landscape as a
                  blind spot in our memory. But how long can a myth keep living?

                  Myths are sites of a shared cultural memory. They are of
                  communal identification and affection; while they shaped the
                  national imagination, they did not always correspond to actual
                  everyday practices and people’s preoccupations.<sup

                  As part of creating a new collective identity, museums had to
                  convey the myths as well. Right after the soviet occupation,
                  all the existing collection works from the National Museum of
                  Art of Moldova were loaded onto two wagons and shipped to
                  Kharkiv in Ukraine. The existence of the works is still
                  unknown today. The works in the museum were replaced by works
                  donated by the Tretyakov State Gallery, Leningrad State
                  Hermitage and A. S. Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in
                  Moscow. To supplement the lost heritage, Moldovan Soviet
                  Socialist Republic was funding museums to commission and
                  purchase works of art.<sup class="footnote"

                  Valentina Rusu-Ciobanu. The work represents an image of the
                  village during autumn in a period of harvesting. The village
                  is equipped with the most modern achievements of technological
                  progress, which shows the great ‘improvements’ made by the
                  state of a colonized land.<sup class="footnote"

                  a communist party is fulfilling its duties. Duties of
                  organizing working life and ensuring communal growth. An image

                  Formally, the artist painted it how the soviet party desired,
                  but behind the formality, she still found a way to leave hints
                  such as industrialization, mechanization and pollution of land
                  pointing to something else symbolically. But in the end, the
                  painting is an image of what the state wanted to see; a
                  mythological image of a desired village.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Even though the painting was made according to the ideological
                  formula, the artist was accused by the party for being too
                  abstract and formalistic<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">17</a></sup
                  >, which meant the message was not clear enough and that it
                  could produce additional meaning. The painting Land and People

                  To remind you; we are still in front of the park in Chisinau,
                  where you can hear an intertwining soundscape of voices mostly
                  composed of Romanian and Russian. What language do we speak?
                  Moldovan or Romanian? And what is the difference? The answer
                  to such questions is a political argument that goes back to
                  1991, where Moldova became independent. Let me start by
                  pointing to the fact that we are filling the gaps in the
                  Romanian language with Russian words, even after the
                  declaration of independence and national movements of
                  restoring the national language. In 2023, the Romanian
                  language was constitutionally recognised as a national
                  language of Moldova.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I don’t want to sound nationalistic, when I write about the
                  effects of colonization and I do acknowledge how no language
                  is unaffected by other languages, but Romanian language
                  carries traces of Russian colonization, which do not originate
                  within the language. The noises that are blending the speech
                  are a trace of such history; forcing one language to translate
                  itself into another. These noises are political embedded codes
                  in our unconsciousness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the Soviet Union, language came to serve as a political
                  tool, when it was used to strengthen the border and to isolate
                  Moldova from Romania. It was a political tool, when it came to
                  “erase any national local differences and to transform the
                  whole body of the country, to a brotherhood nation which
                  speaks the same language”. One example is how the Latin
                  alphabet script was changed to Cyrillic one. When the language
                  of the colony did not have enough shapes for sounds, they had
                  to invent a unique new letter to transcribe the Romanian
                  phonetics. For example with g, ge, ghe /dʒ/, they made the
                  sound zhe with breve “Ӂ ӂ”.The moving towards Cyrillics meant
                  taking part in the national development and homogenizing the
                  whole culture into a land of brothers and sisters. This
                  homogenization meant excluding minorities, as the whole
                  culture was homogenized into a national one.

                  Overall, there is no difference between Romanian and Moldavian
                  language. To see them as different is purely a political tool.
                  The Romanian words were excluded from literature, as it could
                  recall nostalgic feelings that the Soviet Union did not
                  desire. Such feelings would mean uncertainty.

                  In 1950 linguists from abroad started studying the Moldovan
                  language and found that “the only difference they could
                  conclude was writing with Cyrillic alphabet and minor mutation
                  in diphthongs and the backing of some vowels after hard
                  consonants. Tagkivini described it as a mere “dogma of soviet

                  Ion Druta writes about how language was extracted similarly to
                  the land, when the colonizer was cutting the language and
                  modifying it to fit its ideology - similarly to within the
                  painting of Lands and People, as land was extracted and
                  modified to fit into soviet idealism. Differences might be
                  minor, but the idea of a difference and the modifications
                  themselves are still political. At 31th August 1989, the

                  I don’t know why, but I still find it difficult to use words
                  in my native language. There is a constant filter and
                  restructuring of the meaning. Fear, anxiety, and hope to be
                  understood. My language is intertwined between Romanian and
                  Russian. Now such intertwinement is even more complex, as I
                  speak and write in English too. I fumble with words, as
                  silence and errors become my common space; a metaphor for
                  resistance.

                  What are the characteristics of myths? Roland Barthes defines
                  them as the transformation of a meaning into form.<sup
                    class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">23</a></sup

                  To give it a shape, as the meaning becomes a set of
                  pre-designed signifiers. Within myths, meaning is never absent
                  and any absence is considered noise. An example is
                  informational entropy. It is a concept in physics and a
                  metaphor in statistical analysis, which refers to the
                  predictability<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">24</a></sup
                  >
                  of the message. A predictability as a calculation of
                  information probability. The theory explains that information
                  is structured in a set of possible answers that could cover
                  all kinds of possible narratives. So the “freedom of choice”
                  is actually a set of pre-designed choices. All possible errors
                  are considered “noises”. The predictability of the constructed
                  system helps to keep a control and understand the behavior of
                  the system.<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">25</a></sup
                  >
                  In this way, myths become “naturalized”. Myths like to be in a
                  shape that is steady and convincing. Everything outside such a
                  form will be considered noise.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But nothing is perfect and we can’t avoid errors and gaps.
                  Just as grammar works as a framework for language of
                  correctness, myths also carry a grammar. When something is not
                  according to the grammar, it is wrong and limited to A or B.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Uncertainty is what does not live up to the grammar. It is
                  what’s considered noise. Noise becomes the refuse and a
                  leftover generated by the process of information itself.<sup

                  Ray Brassier writes about noise in the article Against an
                  Aesthetics of Noise. According to him, noise is more than an
                  ambivalent object that relates to the true or false
                  foundation. Insteads, it is a space where we can learn about
                  our relation to information, as noise goes beyond the
                  organized form of a system.<sup class="footnote"

                  In the book Listening Biennial, Daniela Medina Poch writes:
                  “Listening allows a space for unlearning and relearning as
                  listening requires being open towards what is being listened
                  to.” As noise is what is refused by a dominant culture and
                  everything outside myths therefore will be considered noise,
                  to listen to such noise is a certain resistance, as noise
                  allows a multitude of voices to speak together, when sound is
                  an interconnected world and not a singular voice, as sound
                  exists because of many relations within spaces and the
                  relationship of cause and effect. As colonization is a voice
                  that homogenizes by silencing the rest, decolonization instead
                  should be focused on listening;<sup class="footnote"
                    ><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">28</a></sup
                  >
                  not overshatter past voices, but to acknowledge those
                  interconnections and a plurality of voices to co-exist.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But to listen does not only remain within sound, it is also a
                  concept that can be applied to history, when listening becomes
                  a form of attention. To pay attention to what surrounds one,
                  not overshatter with a singular worldview and to be open
                  towards the voices and opinions of others. Within these pages,
                  listening has served as a method of looking upon patterns
                  within history and how they resulted in shaping a present
                  Moldova, from which I am from. To look beyond a singular voice
                  of the Soviet Union and instead listen to the relationships of
                  different interconnections that ended up shaping both the
                  Moldovan language, myths and landscape. To listen is to pay
                  attention. And to listen to what has been framed as noise
                  outside a dominant system is an act of resistance.

                  I would like to return to an initial question of: How can we
                  identify the noises within past political naturalized norms?,
                  as I believe it is important to recognize what we have now to
                  understand where our culture is heading. Moldova is not a
                  unique case. Through my chapters, I wrote to understand how
                  it’s land that today is still covered in myths and stories.
                  Myths and stories that were politically reformulated - just
                  like the case of Lazo or paintings that are archived in
                  institutions as crucial. To demystify myths weakens their
                  power. And by knowing they are lies, they become a clean
                  ground to build something new upon. The purpose is not to
                  erase them from history, but the purpose is to change the
                  perception of them as naturalized common grounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I see listening and noise as a political potential, as noise
                  can be a form of resistance that is murmuring between us, but
                  not heard. To listen to them is to accept them and be aware of
                  them. Not only be aware of the noises, but also the doubts and
                  the discomfort that unconsciously are resonating within our
                  bodies. Listening to the noises is a way of understanding our
                  present and geographical language. By tuning into them, we can
                  build new narratives or at least rethink old ones. Noise are
                  hints, when they speak through well-established myths to open
                  up for their political frames.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Myths become vulnerable, when it is possible to find proof
                  against them. Words and narratives can completely change the
                  perception of not only a physical place, but also stay in a
                  collective memory. Language is powerful, when abstract shapes
                  and images end up being able to influence an entire perception
                  of the human mind. By changing the perception of the human
                  mind, the perception of the environment is also changed -
                  resulting in letting everyone become participants of those
                  actions. As we perform the myths and their language, they
                  become our common beliefs - just like in the case of Lazo and
                  the painting Lands and People. Or our language itself gets
                  reshaped to fit into an ideology, as the writing system itself
                  of Moldovan language was changed. But the change does not only
                  stay written on paper. It ends up affecting societies and
                  geographies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Within graphic design as a builder of the visual, it is
                  important to acknowledge such structures, as language is a key
                  element within visual communication. It is a translation
                  between words and images, but such a translation is never
                  neutral, as language is not neutral. An example of the
                  subjectivity of language is the case of Moldova. During the
                  time of colonization, the writing system was changed to fit
                  into an ideology of the Soviet Union. As graphic design is
                  designing narratives for writing and translating between
                  images and words, it is important to remember whose narrative
                  one is translating. And whose structures one is designing for.

                  Returning to the topic of myths, myths are still alive today.
                  They are still between us and their shadows can still be seen.
                  To understand how myths work and how they have been used as
                  political tools is an important act of decolonization. Nothing
                  is singular and any errors and irregularities are hints worth
                  listening to.
