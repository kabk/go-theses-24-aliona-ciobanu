              This thesis explores how myths become embedded in collective identities and how noise can serve as a form
              of resistance to myths. Starting from a personal perspective and moving to a broader one, I’m exploring
              three specific narratives that shape the collective identity in Moldova: language as a political tool for
              homogenization, visual culture as a representation of power and the role of heroes in reinforcing those
              narratives. By researching historical and geopolitical myths, I seek to understand their purpose and
              significance in contemporary society. When myths are utilized as political tools to influence collective
              identities, anything that does not align with the narrative is often perceived as chaos or noise. As such,
              one question remains: What do these noises truly signify?

              <p>
                Geography is never neutral and borders are shaped by politics. I grew up in Moldova; a country with a
                complex history. A country that through decades went through many territorial and political
                transformations. My common physical surroundings are mostly based on post-Soviet imaginaries. Some
                symbols are gradually decaying. Some buildings are becoming ruins and disappearing into the land,
                while other elements keep living in different forms by changing their functionalities. The presence of
                them is a reminder of a past history of colonization.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="part1-block part1-block-3">
              <p>
                I do believe that the ruins, which I in the following chapters name noises, are not limited to their
                physical presence. But they are noises that go deeper into both the culture and language of Moldova. I
                use the term noise from multiple perspectives, as in the frame of colonization see the term as a force,
                which invades a space to influence it. In this way, noise is an unwanted sound, as the suppressed
                culture is infused by another dominant culture. Another perspective on noise is looking upon it as a
                form of resistance, as I refer to noise as a methodology to look beyond set forms and political norms.
                Can noise as involuntary fluctuations become a source for knowledge? A source to detach from what we
                consider normal? And is it possible to reimagine another geography through noise? A possible geography
                of plurality?
              </p>

              <p>
                To take a step back and detach emotionally from the place and history I am from, I use myths as a lens
                to look upon the present and understand it in relation to the past. Myths are common grounds. Common
                stories in which a community’s beliefs are built upon. Through my chapters focused on Moldova, I refer
                to myths as ideological tools with geopolitical intentions. As myths speak about common beliefs, I start
                from the most common places of national identity, language and territory. Every part in this essay is an
                attempt to demystify ruins and how it has come to both shape me, but also a collective memory of
                Moldova. I look upon those structures through the lens of political myths to raise the question: How can
                we identify the noises within the culture of Moldova to move beyond political myths as naturalized
                norms?

                Myths have played a crucial role throughout human history in making sense of difficult natural concepts
                such as why it rains and why a landscape changes. By personifying phenomena or abstract concepts, myths
                provide a narrative framework that can make these concepts more accessible and relatable to human
                understanding. Myths are cultural common places that are perceived as natural in a given culture, but in
                fact were naturalized and their historical, political or literary origins forgotten or disguised.<sup
                  class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Roland Barthes mentions that myths are a type of speech, as myths function as a system of communication
                that generates meaning. Myths are simple stories that through the use of metaphors cut to the core of
                what it means to be human. While new myths emerge from the most daily habits of contemporary life,
                ancient ones are continuously reinterpreted and contextualized within the present. Myths allow us to
                imagine another present, past and future. Myths create bridges from the here and now to the there and
                then.
                <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">2</a></sup>
                As any story, myths need a context to become alive. Every piece of land has its own rules, but what
                happens when they go out of the literature margins and become a political tool? Myths are both embedded
                in our everyday rituals, our language and our visual culture. When these become the result of historical
                political structures, is it still possible to reimagine another time free from such frameworks?
              </p>
              <p>
                Mircea Eliade writes that a traditional society needs myths to live and to have a sense of belonging,
                meaning and security. The myth is regarded as a sacred story and hence a "true history".<sup
                  class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">3</a></sup> Myths become a
                “role model” to follow as an “absolute truth”, in which we believe, when we detach from our personal
                values to act and follow such a “role model”. In this way, myths become a form of excellent cognitive
                thinking performed in the form of rituals.
              </p>
              <p>
                I grew up in Moldova. Moldova has been colonized many times by the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the
                Russian Empire, and the Soviet Union. Thus we still carry the “noise” and traces from such histories and
                different colonizers in the form of food, rituals, celebrations, street names, and even speech. In
                general terms, noise is considered unwanted or loud sounds, but in the context of colonization, I’m
                referring to noise as a symbol of the cultural and ecological pollution of a territory.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the following lines, I’ll try to find answers to these questions by returning home. Returning to the
                last era of colonization, which effects I still hear today. I didn’t grow up directly in the Soviet
                Union. I experienced the effects of it through the subjective perspectives of my family and in the
                patterns that Moldova still carries. The story I bring to you is a subjective one, as I refer to the
                political ideology as a myth. One that has become a role model for more than a decade and has changed
                the collective identity and memory because of its dominance.

              </p>

              <p>
                Let’s begin with the invasion. In 1940 geo-political and geo-strategic interests from the Soviet Union
                in the land of Bessarabia<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">4</a></sup> became more
                intense. In order to hide their geo-strategic interests of
                occupying the territory, a more believable narrative was needed. According to their narrative, Moldova
                was a separate nation with no link to Romania.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1"
                    href="#fn-1">5</a></sup> Instead Moldova had a closer historical identity and
                culture with the Russian, Ukrainian and other Soviet people’s history.

              </p>

              <p>
                So, the “becoming” of the Moldovan nation went through an aggressive intervention at many levels. From a
                political level, the colonization meant canceling a democratic institution and the instauration of a new
                ideology.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">6</a></sup> As the main intention was to
                build a strong military and economic force, the soviet ideology
                meant a transformation and redirection of a whole society. From a societal level, it meant an
                instauration of a new set of beliefs that would facilitate the new ideology.

              </p>
              <p>
                The way of redirecting a whole society was through political myths. Ionuț Isac writes about political
                myths and define them as a subjective belief that provides a common foundational belief system of one’s
                origins, identities and goals on both an individual and collective national level: “Political myth can
                be said to fix its 'referent' at a confluence of objective and subjective, reality and fiction, which
                makes it no "weaker" than an elaborate social theory or ideology, but even more powerful than them, when
                it comes to impressing and moving human communities and collectivities.”<sup class="footnote"><a
                    id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">7</a></sup> Political myths are not
                directly rooted in present reality, but instead they construct a future reality to make people act
                differently in a present, as if the constructed future already exists. <sup class="footnote"><a

                The following lines are based on a documentary movie titled Lazo about Lazo as a mythological character
                from the Soviet Union:<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">10</a></sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                When the Soviets colonized Moldova, a set of symbols was invented to prove the existence of Moldovan
                national identity,<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">11</a></sup> but also to rewrite
                and demystify the local history and its heroes. To recreate a
                collective memory of the local history and demystify it. The country had to deal with an updated version
                of the present and to reimagine a past that served soviet ideals. Sergei Lazo is a character and person
                who was reconstructed as a hero and who is an example of such recreation. He suddenly became a “hero”
                that perfectly fitted into soviet mythology. I’m referring to soviet mythology as a soviet ideology that
                was promoted over the occupied land. In that recreation, he was suddenly dedicated to titles of a series
                of monuments, streets, museums, squares, institutions and factories all around the country.

              </p>

              <p>
                Lazo was born in Moldova into a noble family. During his studies in Sankt Petersburg and Moscow, he was
                active in revolutionary circles. Later he joined the Bolshevik forces and participated in the Russian
                Civil War. At the time, he was not very well known as a dominant figure. In the context of the Civil
                War, the Soviets had to come up with a solution to supplement the lack of dominant figures. So in the
                case of Moldova, the soviets made Lazo become a hero as part of a heroic war.
              </p>

              <p>
                The legend says that Lazo was kept by the Japanese and burned alive. No documentary information could be
                found about this legend except for a few artistic proofs, which sustained the myth, but also left
                viewers with a nationalistic feeling of the past.
              </p>

                One “proof” of the story was the novel titled Kak pogib Sergeĭ Lazo, translated as The Death of Sergei
                Lazo written by soviet novelist Aleksandeer Fadeev. The novel is supported by a series of illustrations
                of the war and has Lazo as a dominant figure.

                Two other artistic proofs were two films commissioned by Moldova Film. One was the commissioning of
                Andrei Tarkovsky and Aleksander Gordon to make a future film about the national hero Sergei Lazo.
                Another one was The Life and Immortality of Sergei Lazo (1985) by V. Pascaru. Both films sustain the
                legend about Lazo as a national hero.

                In the public space, monuments and streets named after the new national hero were appearing. One example
                is in Chisinau, where the park Sergei Lazo was named after him.
              </p>

              <p>
                In Russia nowadays, Lazo is not a hero anymore. The tragic death of Lazo and his life have recently been
                dismissed by researchers as “the country that made him a hero is no longer on the map.”<sup

              <p>
                On a decaying concrete platform, a monument reminds us that the myth is still with us, even when we do
                not recognize its face anymore. A standing hero morphing into the landscape as a blind spot in our
                memory. But how long can a myth keep living?

            <p>
              We didn’t move even one meter from Lazo Park, when I met you. Do
              you remember how we are in Chisinau now? Can you believe what
              you see in front of you? Mythologies are cultural common places,
              recurrent narratives that are perceived as natural in a given
              culture, but in fact were naturalized and their historical,
              political, or literary origins forgotten or disguised.<br /><br />
              As part of creating a new collective identity, museums had to
              convey the myths as well. Right after the soviet occupation, all
              the existing collection works from the young established museum
              (opened in 1939) were loaded onto two wagons and shipped to
              Kharkiv in Ukraine. The existence of the works is still unknown
              today. The works in the museum were replaced by works donated by
              the Tretyakov State Gallery and A. S. Pushkin State Museum of
              Fine Arts in Moscow, as well as by the Leningrad State
              Hermitage.<br /><br />
              To supplement the lost heritage, Moldovan Soviet Socialist
              Republic was funding museums to commission and purchase works of
              art - usually from local masters in the field of fine arts.
              Alongside, a series of donations were made by some collectors
              and prominent personalities in the field of arts from
              Bessarabia.
              <br /><br />
              The system promoted realistic paintings, but was in opposition
              to the pseudo-realist style of socialist academism. A style that
              was advocated by the Academy of Arts of the USSR in the early
              post-war years. However, socialist academism was based on
              exaggerating to the point of absurdity with the forms of
              "fable", "content" and "narrative" in painting.

              One of the works, acquired by the MSSR museum in the period of
              restoring the lost collection, was the painting “Glie și
              Oamenii” in translation “Lands and people”, by Moldovan painter
              Valentina Rusu-Ciobanu, exhibited at the exhibition “Glory to
              the work” in 1975. The work represent an image of the village
              during autumn, in a period of harvesting. The village is
              equipped with the most modern achievements of technological
              progress in the agro-industrial sphere, also showing the great
              improvements, the greate upgrade made by the state on a
              colonised land. Fused with happy looking characters of local
              communal work, dressed in perfect, clean clothes, running
              tractors, electricity towers, somenone is biking somewhere,
              running cars, a red car in front of the main village, as a sigh
              of communist party is duing its duties too, perfectly organised
              working life, actively implicated into a communal growth, a
              communal rhythm, a common place. Everyone is happy, no one human
              presence in the houses of the village, because everyone is on
              the land. The image that showing just a part of something big.
              What can go wrong?
              <br /><br />
              This upgraded version of the Moldovan village, painted following
              the ideological criteria of those years, isn’t that simple and
              perfect. If we take a step back, the image dosen’t feel natural
              at all, even more, the portraited vilage do no exist. The
              painting is just an image of what the state wanted to see, a
              desired image of a village, a mythological image of the space.
              We are looking into an imagination, into a dream, into utopia,
              into a project that wants to change the humans and shape th
              land, in order to achieve its own goals. A “reality”, “virtual
              reality”, covered into a noise of dominant culture, where even
              is hard to depict were that “reality” is.
              <br /><br />
              From another side, the painting is reflecting the spiritual part
              of the place, the transcendental. What dose it mean to be
              suppressed? The language of spiritual is hiden in the language
              of the myth, if we erase the ideological elements, if we take
              apart what “have to be”, then we might find a real village. The
              land is exploited, the culture is modified, the common place
              organised and re-organised, the myth limits, the language is a
              myth, metaphor.
              <br /><br />
              Lands and People refers to the painting of Landscape with the
              Fall of Icarus by Pieter Bruegel, that can be interpreted as
              “the flight of Icarus symbolizes the flight of human thought and
              imagination; the human desire for new discoveries, achievements,
              conquests. In this case, the painting can be interpreted as the
              defeat of the sublime in the struggle against the commonplace,
              which does not care about those who strive for light".
              <br /><br />
              Even thought the painting was made according to the ideological
              formula, the artist was accused by the party for being too
              abstract and formalistic, which meant the message was not too
              clear and it could produce additional meaning. Although the
              party did not even have a clear explanation on what abstract and
              formalistic meant, I guess it did not limit itself to the
              “reality” of the myth. The painting Lands and People, painted in
              the context of the myth is just an example of the tools used by
              the state. Could we relate to our time? Could our images, our
              technology to work in the same way?

              Myths are considered a type of speech. Roland writes that
              language needs special conditions to become a myth. Relating
              this to the history of Moldova, the historical conditions that
              affected the language and its effects can still be heard till
              now.
              <br /><br />
              To just remind you; we are still in front of the park in
              Chisinau. As you can hear, besides the sound of passing cars,
              you will hear an intertwining soundscape of voices mostly
              composed of Romanian and Russian. In our everyday life in common
              places, intertwined communication is something “natural”. It is
              something common. What kind of language do we speak? The answer
              to that is a long-lasting political and social dispute that goes
              back to 1991, when Moldova became independent. Moldovan or
              Romanian? And where is the difference?
              <br /><br />
              Let me start by pointing to the fact that we are filling the
              gaps in the Romanian language with Russian words, even after
              declaration of independence, which count more then 30 years. But
              also after reforms, national movements of restoring the national
              language. In **** year, romanian language was contitutionaly
              recognised a national language. And even before that that was
              also a political tool, but in this case to use moldoval language
              to bring nostalgic feeling about colonial past.
              <br /><br />
              I don’t want to sound nationalistic, when I write about the
              effects of colonization and I do acknowledge how no language is
              not affected by other languages anymore, but Romanian language
              carries traces of Russian colonization, which do not originate
              within the language. The noises that are blending the speech,
              the sentences, filling it till we can formulate a whole message
              are a trace of such history; forcing one language to translate
              itself into another. Till you can understand what we want to
              say. This is not accidental. These noises are political embedded
              codes in our unconsciousness.

              During Soviet Union, language came to serve as a political tool,
              when it was used to strengthen the border, to “protect” the
              people and to isolate Moldova from Romania. It was a political
              tool when it came to “erase any national local differences and
              to transform the whole body of the country, to a brotherhood
              nation which speaks the same language”. One example is how the
              Latin alphabet script was changed to Cyrillic one. In order to
              expand the communist idology, and combat illiteracy. When the
              language of the colony did not have enough shapes for sounds,
              they had to invent a unique new letter to transcribe the
              Romanian phonetics. For example with g, ge, ghe /dʒ/, they made
              the sound zhe with breve “Ӂ ӂ”.The moving towards Cyrillics
              meant taking part in the national development and homogenizing
              the whole culture into a land of brothers and sisters. This
              homogenization meant excluding any minorities, as the whole
              culture was homogenized into national. Along with that
              transformation, another Russian language had apriveledged
              position, was a language of the state, formal language. As well
              russian was studied at schools, as well mixing russian and
              romanian (then moldovan language) school, in this way
              facilitating bilinvism.
              <br /><br />
              The language went through a massive act of brushing from the
              Romanian words, along with literature, songs and anything that
              could remind or produce nostalgic feelings about the past. But
              overall, there is no difference between Romanian and Moldavian
              language. To see them as different is purely a political tool.
              The romanian words was excluded from literature, as it could
              recall the nostalgic feelings that the Soviet Union did not
              desire. Such feelings would mean uncertainty. In 1950 linguists
              from abroad started studying the Moldovan language and found
              that “the only difference they could conclude was writing with
              Cyrillic alphabet and minor mutation in diphthongs and the
              backing of some vowels after hard consonants. Tagkivini
              described it as a mere “dogma of soviet linguistics”. As such
              any differences are minor.
              <br /><br />

              The national uprising and the de-russification processes came at
              the end of the 1980s, when Moldova reverted to the Latin
              spelling. In the text Land, water and Commas from 1987, Ion
              Druta refers to language as a limited source and as a natural
              resource, which was exploited like land. He writes that
              resources refer to culture, language, and history, which
              impacted the poverty of the spirit, the cosmos of man, the
              ecology of man and so the ecology of the soul. In addition to
              the damage caused by the phantasmagorical tendencies of the
              system, the language has also suffered a lot. Its charm has
              begun to disappear and instead turned into a dirty, grey
              language. A language that blocks even those who were
              participating in a conversation; no longer understanding what
              they want to say to each other.
              <br /><br />
              In 2003 a controversial Romanian-Moldovan dictionary was
              published, being the first and only one of its kind. The book
              represented a sum of archaism, regionalism, and russificated
              words specific to the Moldovan area. The book pretends to show
              that the Moldovan language is something different from the
              Romanian one, but in fact is a sum of old and modified words,
              translated into modern romanian language, but from another side

              Even though I don’t know why, I still find it difficult to use
              words in my native language. There is a constant filter and
              restructuring of the meaning. Fear, anxiety, and hope to be
              understood. My language is intertwined between Romanian and
              Russian, and now even more complex, with English too. All those
              words come to fill the gaps. In the end, silence and errors are
              a common space; a metaphor for resistance.

              Part four. Making noise
              What are the characteristics of myths? Roland Barthes defines them as the transformation of a meaning into
              form. To give it a shape, as the meaning becomes a set of pre-designed signifiers. Within myths, meaning
              is never absent and any absence is considered noise. An example is informational entropy. It is a concept
              in physics and a metaphor in statistical analysis, which refers to the predictability of the message. A
              predictability as a calculation of information probability. The theory explains that information is
              structured in a set of possible answers that could cover all kinds of possible narratives. So the “freedom
              of choice” is actually a set of pre-designed choices. All possible errors are considered “noises”. The
              predictability of the constructed system helps to keep a control and understand the behavior of the
              system. In this way, myths become “naturalized”. Myths like to be in a shape that is steady and
              convincing. Everything outside such a form will be considered noise.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              But nothing is perfect and we can’t avoid errors and gaps. Just as grammar works as a framework for
              language of correctness, myths also carry a grammar. When something is not according to the grammar, it is
              wrong and limited to A or B.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Uncertainty is what does not live up to the grammar. It is what’s considered noise. Noise becomes the
              refuse and a leftover generated by the process of information itself. Ray Brassier writes about noise in
              the article Against an Aesthetics of Noise. According to him, noise is more than an ambivalent object that
              relates to the true or false foundation. Insteads, it is a space where we can learn about our relation to
              information, as noise goes beyond the organized form of a system.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              In the book Listening Biennial, Daniela Medina Poch writes: “Listening allows a space for unlearning and
              relearning as listening requires being open towards what is being listened to.” As noise is what is
              refused by a dominant culture and everything outside myths therefore will be considered noise, to listen
              to such noise is a certain resistance, as noise allows a multitude of voices to speak together, when sound
              is an interconnected world and not a singular voice, as sound exists because of many relations within
              spaces and the relationship of cause and effect. As colonization is a voice that homogenizes by silencing
              the rest, decolonization instead should be focused on listening; not overshatter past voices, but to
              acknowledge those interconnections and a plurality of voices to co-exist.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              But to listen does not only remain within sound, it is also a concept that can be applied to history, when
              listening becomes a form of attention. To pay attention to what surrounds one, not overshatter with a
              singular worldview and to be open towards the voices and opinions of others. Within these pages, listening
              has served as a method of looking upon patterns within history and how they resulted in shaping a present
              Moldova, from which I am from. To look beyond a singular voice of the Soviet Union and instead listen to
              the relationships of different interconnections that ended up shaping both the Moldovan language, myths
              and landscape. To listen is to pay attention. And to listen to what has been framed as noise outside a
              dominant system is an act of resistance.
